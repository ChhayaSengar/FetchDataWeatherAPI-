# Fetch Data From Weather and  Geolocation API-

1.> Create a weather api app and handle 2 api calls. 

2.> By default the user lands on the landing screen which just shows the fetch data button.

3.> On clicking the fetch data button, first the geolocation api returns the lat and long and displays a google map of the current location. 
  Then the weather data section shows, where all the details provided in the api response are handled.

4.> Use the geolocation API to get your current laptop's lat and long.

5.> use https://openweathermap.org/api/one-call-3 api to get the weather via the lat and long provided by the geolocation api.
